      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>I am a Senior at Lewis University majoring in computer science, which I
        found an interest in, in my sophmore year of highschool, and I have a minor
        in math which I didn't realize I was even good at until college. I found
        it an interesting subject as it requires you to work with your creativity
        and be able to build something in a way humans have never done before. This is actually
        only my second year at Lewis though as I transferred over here from the College
        of Lake County which has its main campus in Grayslake Illinois. I have a brother
        named TJ, and my parents are John, and Julie, and have two golden retrievers named
        Cortland and Holly who always get furious with me whenever I have work to do. I also
        have a girlfriend named Jamie who I've been with since my Senior year of highschool who
        also happens to go to Lewis as well.
      </p>

      <h2>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h2>
      <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
        <li>Increase my programming knowledge</li>
        <li>Imorove programming efficiency</li>
        <li>Working better with a team</li>
        <li>Increase my understanding of the software engineering field</li>
        <li>Improve my knowledge on concepts I may have not even heard of yet</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>My Favorite Hobby / Activity</h2>
      <p>Some of my favorite hobbies growing up has been fishing, hockey, and football
        which I have been enjoying for as long as I've remember. Football and hockey has
        become more of a watching kind of thing now as I've been focusing more on school
        now and I don't plan on being a professional. I will still at least play a little
        hockey with one of my friends that I've always played it with growing up when we're
        not busy. When it comes to football I'm a Bears fan and always will be no matter
        how bad they always have to stink every year sadly, but things come around eventually
        so we'll see what happens. Fishing is something that I always liked to as
        it's a very relaxing thing to do which can be fun at the same time,
        and is certainly a great teacher of patience.
